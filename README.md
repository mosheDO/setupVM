Installing Docker Compose on Linux

On macOS and Windows, you should already have Docker Compose installed - it's set up together with Docker there.

On Linux machines, you need to install it separately.

These steps should get you there:

1. sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

2. sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

3. sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose

4. to verify: docker-compose --version
